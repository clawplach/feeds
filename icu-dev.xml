  <description>
ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode
and Globalization support for software applications. ICU is widely portable and
gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java
software.

ICU is released under a nonrestrictive open source license that is suitable for
use with both commercial software and with other open source or free software.

Here are a few highlights of the services provided by ICU:

Code Page Conversion: Convert text data to or from Unicode and nearly any other
character set or encoding. ICU's conversion tables are based on charset data
collected by IBM over the course of many decades, and is the most complete
available anywhere.

Collation: Compare strings according to the conventions and standards of a
particular language, region or country. ICU's collation is based on the Unicode
Collation Algorithm plus locale-specific comparison rules from the Common Locale
Data Repository, a comprehensive source for this type of data.

Formatting: Format numbers, dates, times and currency amounts according the
conventions of a chosen locale. This includes translating month and day names
into the selected language, choosing appropriate abbreviations, ordering fields
correctly, etc. This data also comes from the Common Locale Data Repository.

Time Calculations: Multiple types of calendars are provided beyond the
traditional Gregorian calendar. A thorough set of timezone calculation APIs are
provided.

Unicode Support: ICU closely tracks the Unicode standard, providing easy access
to all of the many Unicode character properties, Unicode Normalization, Case
Folding and other fundamental operations as specified by the Unicode Standard.

Regular Expression: ICU's regular expressions fully support Unicode while
providing very competitive performance.

Bidi: support for handling text containing a mixture of left to right (English)
and right to left (Arabic or Hebrew) data.

Text Boundaries: Locate the positions of words, sentences, paragraphs within a
range of text, or identify locations that would be suitable for line wrapping
when displaying the text.

And much more. Refer to the ICU User Guide for details.</description>
