  <summary>A Massively Spiffy Yet Delicately Unobtrusive Compression Library</summary>
  <description>
zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that is,
not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on
virtually any computer hardware and operating system. The zlib data format is
itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method used in Unix
compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used
in zlib essentially never expands the data. (LZW can double or triple the file
size in extreme cases.) zlib's memory footprint is also independent of the input
data and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost in compression. A more
precise, technical discussion of both points is available on another page.

zlib was written by Jean-loup Gailly (compression) and Mark Adler
(decompression). Jean-loup is also the primary author/maintainer of gzip(1), the
author of the comp.compression FAQ list and the former maintainer of Info-ZIP's
Zip; Mark is also the author of gzip's and UnZip's main decompression routines
and was the original author of Zip. Not surprisingly, the compression algorithm
used in zlib is essentially the same as that in gzip and Zip, namely, the
`deflate' method that originated in PKWARE's PKZIP 2.x.

The lovely zlib-vise image above was provided courtesy of Bruce Gardner, art
director of Dr. Dobb's Journal. It appears in Mark Nelson's article in the
January 1997 issue (see below).
