  <summary>a block-sorting file compressor</summary>
  <description>
bzip2 is a freely available, patent free (see below), high-quality data
compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best
available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being
around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

The current version is 1.0.6, released 20 Sept 2010.

Version 1.0.6 removes a potential security vulnerability, CVE-2010-0405, so all
users are recommended to upgrade immediately.

Why would I want to use it?

• Because it compresses well. So it packs more stuff into your overfull disk
drives, distribution CDs, backup tapes, USB sticks, etc. And/or it reduces your
customer download times, long distance network traffic, etc. It's not the
world's fastest compressor, but it's still fast enough to be very useful.

• Because it's open-source (BSD-style license), and, as far as I know, patent-
free. (To the best of my knowledge. I can't afford to do a full patent search,
so I can't guarantee this. Caveat emptor). So you can use it for whatever you
like. Naturally, the source code is part of the distribution.

• Because it supports (limited) recovery from media errors. If you are trying
to restore compressed data from a backup tape or disk, and that data contains
some errors, bzip2 may still be able to decompress those parts of the file which
are undamaged.

• Because you already know how to use it. bzip2's command line flags are
similar to those of GNU Gzip, so if you know how to use gzip, you know how to
use bzip2.

• Because it's very portable. It should run on any 32 or 64-bit machine with
an ANSI C compiler. The distribution should compile unmodified on Unix and Win32
systems. Earlier versions have been ported with little difficulty to a large
number of weird and wonderful systems.

The code is organised as a library with a programming interface. The bzip2
program itself is a client of the library. You can use the library in your own
programs, to directly read and write .bz2 files, or even just to compress data
in memory using the bzip2 algorithms.</description>
